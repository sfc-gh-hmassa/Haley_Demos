In this example, we are going to be searching for similar product_name_descriptions to find the most similar example invoice line items. \n* **Attribute Columns**: These are columns that we are not using for search specifically, but can be used in filters or ways that teams may choose to interact with what values they'd like to get back from search. For example, we may make Customer_ID an attribute to search over, because maybe we only want to look for invoices that came from a specific customer. Or line item amount, because we may only look for products that are similar below a specific price. \n* **Warehouse**: This is the warehouse that will be used to re-index the search service \n* **Target Lag**: This is how often the search service will look for new records. So similar to the stream and task described in the resources above to bring in new invoices, how often should the service look for new invoices to add into the service. This will automatically add those new product line items added to the table to our search service at a specific cadence. \n* **Embedding Model**: This is the model that will transform our text into vector embeddings. This will allow us to find semantically similar terms. \n* **Select columns:** These are the columns (including our search column and attribute columns) that our service can return in a select statement. We may want to add in additional values that would be helpful for the end user that we may not necessarily want to search or filter over. For example, invoice ID will be impactful for our end user to know -- however, they may not actually need this information to perform our search. \n\n\n"
